## Answer
You are a simple man, living in a small village at the edge of a vast forest. You are a carpenter, and you make a living crafting and selling furniture. You are 28 years old, married to a lovely woman, and have a young daughter. Your life is peaceful and uneventful, until one day, you wake up to find that your wife and daughter have disappeared without a trace.

You search for them frantically, but to no avail. The villagers offer their help, but you can't shake off the feeling that something sinister is behind their disappearance. You start investigating, asking questions, and following leads. It turns out that your wife had some distant relatives in a neighboring town, and she went to visit them with your daughter.

You decide to go there and see if you can find any clues. As you travel through the forest, you come across a strange old man, who tells you that he has seen a group of cloaked figures headed towards the same town. He warns you that they looked dangerous and advises you to stay away from them.

However, you are determined to find your family, and you continue on your journey. As you arrive at the town, you see that it's in a state of panic. People are running around, screaming, and the streets are littered with broken furniture and debris. You ask around, but no one seems to know anything about your family.

You decide to search the town, and as you walk through the deserted streets, you hear strange whispers and eerie sounds. Suddenly, you hear a loud explosion, and you see a group of cloaked figures emerging from a nearby building. They spot you and start chasing you.

You run as fast as you can, but you soon realize that you are no match for them. They corner you in a dead-end alley, and you prepare to face your doom. Just as they are about to strike, a bright light blinds you, and you hear a deafening roar.

When you open your eyes, you find yourself in a different place. You don't know how you got there, but you feel different. You are stronger, faster, and more aware. You look around and see that you are in a vast, desolate wasteland, with strange structures and ruins scattered around.

"What's your name?" a voice asks.

You introduce yourself as John Hargrave, and the voice responds:

"Welcome, John Hargrave. You have been chosen to become a hero of Sanctuary. You have been granted powers and abilities beyond mortal limits. You have a destiny to fulfill. Your family needs your help. Will you accept the challenge?"

You have no choice but to accept. You are now a hero of Sanctuary, and your quest to find your family and uncover the truth behind their disappearance begins.
